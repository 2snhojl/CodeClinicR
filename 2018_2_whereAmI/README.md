Code Clinic: Where Am I?
================

Hello, and welcome to the second problem of the Code Clinic Series. This problem is titled: "Where Am I" and demonstrates how to create geolocation applications. 

Every modern computer has the ability to find it's location. HTML5 has the Geolocation API. Google Maps returns a location and accuracy radius for mobile phones based on WiFI and cell towers. Some libraries map the computer's IP address to a longitude and latitude. Some methods are more accurate than others. On-board GPS is going to be more accurate than trying to guess WiFi addresses. But each method can provide some indication of where the computer is located. 

In this code clinic challenge, we're challenging our authors to create a geolocation app to show the location of the computer running their code. Their solution should reveal the longitude and latitude of the current location, as well as an indicator of how accurate that location is, expressed as a radius from the revealed longitude and latitude measured in kilometers. 

This challenge is going to require a bit of resourcefulness from our authors. They'll need to find a location, possibly convert from one data structure to another, and perhaps convert from one unit of measure to another. 

Before you watch this solution, you might want to do a bit of research on geolocation and possibly try solving the problem on your own. 

Alright authors â€“ get out your sextant, compass and map. Show us where we are!
