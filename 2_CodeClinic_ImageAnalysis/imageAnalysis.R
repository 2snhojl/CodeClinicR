# Rimage offers diverse filtering functions but supports only the 
#   JPEG format and cannot save images. 
# The package ripa is dedicated to the analysis of hyperspectral 
#   images but does not provide for image segmentation. 
# biOps offers a wide range of image filters, but only supports 
#   the JPEG and TIFF formats and lacks a fast interactive display interface. 
# The recent package RImageJ provides R bindings to ImageJ, 
#   but does not allow easy access to the image data by R.
