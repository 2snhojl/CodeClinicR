Hello, and welcome to the sixth and final problem of the Code Clinic Series.
This is a challenge to create an information dashboard.
We live in a ocean of information.
In many cases, there's too much information to draw useful conclusions. We need to summarize and visualize that information for it to be useful.
That's where dashboards have become popular. 
Dashboards are a visual representation of information that indicate progress or status of a process.
They include charts and graphs, sometimes pictures. 
Sometimes they are interactive and allow asking "What if?" questions.
In this challenge, we are asking our authors to create a dashboard that represents the status of a fictional manufacturing process.
The status is contained in a text file with a days worth of observations, one per second.
Each observation includes a time stamp and the status of several processes at that time.
The challenge to our authors is to create a dashboard that shows the status of each process at the current simulated time.
For example: at 4 pm local time, the dashboard should show the values in the data set corresponding to 16:00:00,
For extra credit, we also supply a list of functions that affect some of the processes. Authors can choose to allow for interactive control of those values. For example, one variable is a sawtooth wave with an inversion point. The value increases in a linear ramp, when it reaches the inversion point, it decreases on a linear ramp. 


Authors could choose to allow for experimentation with the value of limitY, showing the result in the graph.
Before you go any further, take some time and solve the problem yourself. You'll get a better appreciation for the challenge our authors face.
Collecting data is important. But not as important as understanding what it means. Authors â€“ Show us what this all means.
